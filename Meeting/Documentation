 *
 * Description:
 * This Java program demonstrates a system for managing meetings, participants, and refreshments. It uses interfaces,
 * classes, and multithreading to provide functionality for creating, saving, and loading meeting and participant data
 * to/from files. It also simulates serving refreshments to participants.

 * Interfaces:
 * - `Eat`: Defines methods for serving refreshments to participants and providing a string representation.
 * - `SerializableToFile`: Defines methods for saving and loading objects to/from files.

 * Classes:
 * - `Meeting`: Represents a meeting with properties like title, date, location, and agenda items.
 *   - Methods: addAgendaItem(), displayMeetingDetails()
 * - `Participant`: Represents a participant with properties like age, name, and email.
 *   - Methods: consumeRefreshments()
 * - `Refreshment`: Represents refreshments with properties like coffee, water, and snacks.
 *   - Methods: serveRefreshments()
 * - `FileOperationThread`: Extends Thread and performs file operations (save/load) in separate threads.

 * Main Class:
 * - `Main`: Entry point of the program. Demonstrates the usage of the above classes and interfaces.
 *   - Creates meetings, participants, and refreshments.
 *   - Saves and loads data to/from files using multithreading.

 * Usage:
 * - Compile and run the program to interact with meetings, participants, and refreshments.
 * - Data is saved to and loaded from files using separate threads.

 * Note:
 * - This code provides a basic example of file I/O and object serialization in Java.
 * - Error handling is simplified for demonstration purposes and may need enhancement for production use.
